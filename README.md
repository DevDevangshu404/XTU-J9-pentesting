# Penetration Test on XTU J9 Smart Doorbell Camera

This project documents a detailed penetration test conducted on the XTU J9 Smart Doorbell Camera, focusing on the device setup, communication channels, and mobile application security.

## Key Highlights:
- **QR Code Forgery**: Demonstrated vulnerability where attackers could forge QR codes to gain unauthorized access.\
- **Unencrypted Data Transmission**: Sensitive video and audio streams were transmitted over HTTP, exposing them to interception.\
- **Deauthentication Attack**: Successfully disrupted the doorbell's Wi-Fi connection using deauthentication frames.\
- **Application Security Issues**: Weak encryption and insecure storage of sensitive data in the Android app.\

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Wireshark**, **Burp Suite**, **APKTool**, **Nmap**, **Aircrack-ng**, **MobSF**\


## Folder Structure:

- **`Burp_logs.pdf`**: Burp Suite logs highlighting insecure traffic and API endpoints.\
- **`Wireshark_Captures/`**: Wireshark captures showing insecure communication.\
- **`MobSF_Report.pdf`**: MobSF static analysis report with identified vulnerabilities in the Android app.\
- **`Reversed_Code_Snippets/`**: Relevant code snippets demonstrating vulnerabilities (e.g., weak encryption, SQL injection).\
